Sure, let's go through each SQL concept with an example:

1. **Create Table**
   - Example:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE employees (
         employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
         first_name VARCHAR(50),
         last_name VARCHAR(50),
         department_id INT
     );
     ```
   - Explanation: This creates a table named `employees` with columns for `employee_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, and `department_id`.

2. **Drop Table**
   - Example:
     ```sql
     DROP TABLE employees;
     ```
   - Explanation: This deletes the `employees` table from the database.

3. **Select Statement**
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM employees;
     ```
   - Explanation: This retrieves all data from the `employees` table.

4. **Insert Values**
   - Example:
     ```sql
     INSERT INTO employees VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', 101);
     ```
   - Explanation: This inserts a new employee record into the `employees` table with `employee_id` 1, `first_name` John, `last_name` Doe, and `department_id` 101.

5. **Limiting Columns**
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees;
     ```
   - Explanation: This retrieves only the `first_name` and `last_name` columns from the `employees` table.

6. **Limiting Rows**
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT TOP 5 * FROM employees;
     ```
   - Explanation: This retrieves the top 5 records from the `employees` table.

7. **Alter Table**
   - Example (Change Column Data Type and Size):
     ```sql
     ALTER TABLE employees
     ALTER COLUMN department_id VARCHAR(10);
     ```
   - Explanation: This changes the data type of the `department_id` column in the `employees` table to `VARCHAR(10)`.

   - Example (Add New Column):
     ```sql
     ALTER TABLE employees
     ADD hire_date DATE;
     ```
   - Explanation: This adds a new column named `hire_date` to the `employees` table.

   - Example (Drop Column):
     ```sql
     ALTER TABLE employees
     DROP COLUMN department_id;
     ```
   - Explanation: This removes the `department_id` column from the `employees` table.

8. **Update Statement**
   - Example:
     ```sql
     UPDATE employees
     SET department_id = 102
     WHERE employee_id = 1;
     ```
   - Explanation: This updates the `department_id` of the employee with `employee_id` 1 to 102.

9. **Delete Statement**
   - Example:
     ```sql
     DELETE FROM employees
     WHERE employee_id = 1;
     ```
   - Explanation: This deletes the employee with `employee_id` 1 from the `employees` table.

10. **Order By**
    - Example:
      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM employees
      ORDER BY last_name ASC, first_name ASC;
      ```
    - Explanation: This retrieves all records from the `employees` table and sorts them by `last_name` in ascending order, then by `first_name` in ascending order.
