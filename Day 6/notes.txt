**Self Join**

**Definition:**
A self join is a regular join, but the table is joined with itself. This is useful when comparing rows within the same table.

**Usage:**
- When you need to relate rows of a table to other rows of the same table.
- Often used to find hierarchical relationships, such as employees and their managers.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT e1.emp_name, e2.emp_name AS manager_name
FROM employee e1
INNER JOIN employee e2 ON e1.manager_id = e2.emp_id;
```
**Explanation:** The query joins the `employee` table with itself to find each employee's manager by matching `manager_id` in `e1` with `emp_id` in `e2`.

**STRING_AGG**

**Definition:**
STRING_AGG is an aggregate function that concatenates values from multiple rows into a single string, with a specified separator.

**Usage:**
- When you need to create a comma-separated list (or any other separator) from column values.
- Useful for summarizing information in a readable format.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT dept_id, STRING_AGG(emp_name, ',') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY emp_name DESC) AS list_of_emp
FROM employee
GROUP BY dept_id;
```
**Explanation:** This query concatenates the `emp_name` values for each `dept_id` into a single string, separated by commas, and ordered by `emp_name` in descending order.

---

**DATEDIFF**

**Definition:**
DATEDIFF is a function that calculates the difference between two dates, returning the result in the specified date part (e.g., days, months, years).

**Usage:**
- When you need to find the time span between two dates.
- Commonly used in reports and date comparisons.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT order_date, ship_date, DATEDIFF(day, order_date, ship_date) AS time_taken
FROM super;
```
**Explanation:** This query calculates the number of days between `order_date` and `ship_date`.

---

**DATEPART**

**Definition:**
DATEPART is a function that extracts a specific part of a date, such as the year, month, day, week, etc.

**Usage:**
- When you need to isolate specific parts of a date for filtering, grouping, or display purposes.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT order_date, DATEPART(yy, order_date) AS order_year, DATEPART(m, order_date) AS order_month
FROM super;
```
**Explanation:** This query extracts the year and month from `order_date`.

---

**DATENAME**

**Definition:**
DATENAME is a function that returns the name of the specified date part (e.g., day of the week, month name) as a string.

**Usage:**
- When you need a human-readable name for a specific part of a date.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT order_date, DATENAME(yy, order_date) AS order_year, DATENAME(m, order_date) AS order_month
FROM super;
```
**Explanation:** This query returns the year and the name of the month from `order_date`.

---

**CASE ... END**

**Definition:**
The CASE statement is used to create conditional logic within SQL queries. It allows you to return different values based on specified conditions.

**Usage:**
- When you need to perform if-then-else logic in SQL.
- Useful for categorizing data and creating computed columns.

**Example:**
sql
SELECT order_id, profit,
CASE
    WHEN profit < 100 THEN 'Low Profit'
    WHEN profit < 250 THEN 'Medium Profit'
    WHEN profit < 400 THEN 'High Profit'
    ELSE 'Very High Profit'
END AS profit_category
FROM super;

Explanation: This query categorizes `profit` into different categories based on its value.
